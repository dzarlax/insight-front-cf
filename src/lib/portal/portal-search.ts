 * The portal's navigation state, carried in the URL.
 *
 * Everything that answers "what am I looking at" lives here rather than in a
 * store: a reload restores the same screen, a link reproduces it for someone
 * else, and Back means what it says. Only true preferences — is the portal on,
 * are planned sections shown — stay in localStorage, because they describe the
 * reader, not the view.
 *
 * All fields are optional and the defaults are computed, not stored: an absent
 * `zone` means "the landing zone for this viewer", an absent `scope` means "the
 * viewer's own subtree". That keeps a shared link honest — it pins what the
 * sender actually chose and lets everything else resolve for the recipient.
