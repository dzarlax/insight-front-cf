 * Why a navigation entry has nothing behind it. Three genuinely different
 * causes that must not look alike to the reader:
 *
 * - **absent** (the default, no marker) — the surface is built and backed by
 *   data. If it still renders empty, that is a per-tenant data gap and the
 *   view says which source is missing. Always visible: the gap IS the signal.
 * - **`planned`** — the product does not model this yet (a metric family is
 *   not in the semantic layer). Identical for every tenant. Kept visible but
 *   demoted, because it tells a reader the domain exists in our model.
 * - **`unbuilt`** — WE have not built the screen yet, though the data path
 *   exists. This is our backlog, not roadmap communication: hidden unless the
 *   viewer opts into seeing planned work.
 *
 * Rendering a tenant data gap and our own unfinished UI the same way is what
 * makes both meaningless, which is why the distinction is in the model rather
 * than in prose.
